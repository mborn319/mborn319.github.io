          <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/mike-thumb.jpg" alt="Michael Born sits at a desk smiling with an iMac and lamp in the background" /><caption>The author in his natural (office) habitat.</span>In a little web agency in the little town of New Hartford, I entered the office and waved to my coworkers, Nick and Patrick. Nick was a buff client manager with dark spiked hair, Patrick was a red-bearded 20-something designer.</p>
          <p>“Good morning clowns!” I cheerfully called in yet another attempt to rouse the office spirit. I dropped my keys on the desk and plopped down in the cushy leather La-Z-Boy.</p>
          <p>“Yeah yeah, getting funnier all the time”, Nick replied. Patrick said nothing, though I thought I detected a grin underneath his red bristles. With nothing left for a comeback, I settled in for another day’s programming. Little did I know what this day had in store.</p>

            <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/david-thumb.jpg" alt="David smiles at his desk" /><caption>David. He may look harmless...</caption></span>Enter David, the central character in our tale of woe. David was yet another bearded 20-something, only he was a developer intern and not a full-time designer. David had been with the company for less than 6 months and was quickly proving his worth as a young programmer with a keen mind and propensity for absorbing technical concepts.</p>
            <p>“Hey Mike. What’s’up guys”, David spoke softly as he glided into his desk. From the other side of my cubicle I could hear him typing in his iMac password and getting set up for the day. </p>
            <blockquote>
              I despaired. I cried. I wrote emails and never sent them. David had gone, ostensibly for the day. I was the sole developer in a room full of 20-somethings.
            </blockquote>
            <p>I didn’t answer David’s more-or-less rhetorical greeting. Both of us had full schedules, so I let the office settle into the 8-hour workday. Little did I know that David had made plans for lunch. This would prove to be our undoing.</p>

					<section>
            <p>It had been a frustrating day thus far. Plagued with issues in my software project, I had eaten a late lunch consisting of salad and a tomato sandwich while staring at my screen and wondering why life was so hard. David had mostly solved his own problems, but I had struggled with maintaining focus through support tickets, multiple emails and a busy office.</p>
            <blockquote>Gone for the day. The words echoed in my ears. End of intern. Gone for the day.</blockquote>
            <p>Restless, I stretched my legs and headed for the break room, intending to grab a mug of hot tea, when I passed David’s chair. To my utter amazement, the chair was empty. I looked around the room. No David. “Is he gone?” I stuttered incredulously. </p>
            <p>Nick looked up. “David?”</p>
            <p>I nodded, wildly waving to the vacant desk. “Did he just leave?” There were a lot of projects on David’s plate. I needed someone to continue the frontend work and collaborate with Nick and Patrick; I had no time to fraternize with anything but code.</p>
            <p>Patrick grinned, this time visibly through his whiskers. “He snuck out a couple minutes ago, didn’t say nuthin’.” His grin faded. “Gone for the day?”</p>
            <blockquote>I was in my chair, drowning my woes in honey wheat pretzel sticks and apple cinnamon tea.</blockquote>
            <p><em>Gone for the day</em>. The words echoed in my ears. End of intern. Gone for the day. Unfinished work. Overtime. Gone for the day. And worst of all, I hadn’t been informed. I was lead developer at a web development and advertising agency - if anyone should have known this was coming, it was me.</p>
            <p>I despaired. I cried. I wrote emails and never sent them. David had gone, ostensibly for the day. I was the sole developer in a room full of 20-somethings.</p>

            <p>David was gone. Plead, petition or pray, it seemed doubtful David would be back until 9AM the next morning. By that time, the damage would be done and the volcano of work would have erupted, leveling the desks and cubicles for miles around the site.</p>
            <p>Then, wonder of wonders, I heard a rustle across from my cubicle wall. I was in my chair, drowning my woes in honey wheat pretzel sticks and apple cinnamon tea. I hesitated. Could it? </p>
            <p>“David?” I softly called out.</p>
            <p>“Sup Mike,” the familiar voice spoke back. “Missed a great lunch, bro.”</p>

						<h2>Denouement</h2>

          <section>
            <p>Studies have been conducted on the effect of interns napping during the workday (interns ) and the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/southwestern-university/what-job-statistics-say-a_b_5399641.html">correlation between higher GPA and employment outcome</a>, while entire books have been written about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intern-Nation-Nothing-Little-Economy/dp/1844676862/">massive number of interns in the workforce</a>. None of these resources deal with the damage to the gross national product resulting from inappropriate office behavior, and certainly none of them helped us when we needed a steady intern with a lack of hunger.</p>
            <p>I wrote this article to warn others. I never saw the warning signs. David was smart - too smart. I had taken him for granted, and at the moment I danced over the bear rug, the bear walked away, leaving me to trip and spiral out of control onto the wood floor of life.</p>
            <p>Don’t let your interns go to lunch. They may never come back.</p>
